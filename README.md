## About the Project

- The login, registration, and access process is based on Firebase authentication mechanisms. Users can create accounts, log in, and access specific features and resources on the site using Firebase authentication mechanisms. This is facilitated through the ProtectedRoute modules, which enable secure and efficient handling of authentication processes.


- On the userPage website, the user can add their photo, which is saved in fairbase storage and each time they log in to their account they still have their photo. Each user can only have one unique photo. The photo has been limited to .jpg format. Users can add their interests related to Nika below. Interests are saved on localStorage and are downloaded again each time the page is opened.
